# Gilded Glory - 1.20.1

The metalsmith's dream!  

Gilded glory is a relatively small mod which adds new metals, a new in-world crafting system which mimics [forge welding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_welding), signature weapons crafted using said metals, decorative building blocks and other miscellaneous items.  

This mod is mainly used as a space for me to add fun weapons I would like to play with, experiment with the capabilities of minecraft modding, and learn more about game design & the usage of java.
